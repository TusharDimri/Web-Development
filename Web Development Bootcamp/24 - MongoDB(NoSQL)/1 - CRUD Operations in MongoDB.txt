In your terminal type:
mongod - This will start our mongo server.

Now, open a new terminal while the previous one is left open. Now, type mongo in the new terminal.

We can type "help" inside the mongo shell to get the list of things we can do.

1. show dbs - See the databases in our system(admin, config and local are preloaded in the system).

2. use "database-name" - This command will create a new database or open an existing database.

3. show  collections: This will show the connections inside our database.

CRUD Operations: 

I) Create data in our database:

db.products.insertOne({
	_id: 1,
	name: "Pen",
	price: 1.2
})
Here, products is the name of the collection which we want inside our database.


II) Read the data from our database:

db.products.find({}) - This will list all the elements inside the collection products.

db.products.find({
	name: "Pencil",
})

db.products.find({price: {$gt: 1}})
Here, $gt is for greater than. Check out the MongoDB documentation for more.

db.products.find({_id:1}, {name:1})
Above query will list the name of the product with id 1. The second parameter is the projection and 1 specifies true. The projection tells which fields we want back.


III) Update Data:
db.products.updateOne({_id:1}, {$set:{stock:32}})


IV) Delete Data:
db.products.deleteOne({_id:2})
