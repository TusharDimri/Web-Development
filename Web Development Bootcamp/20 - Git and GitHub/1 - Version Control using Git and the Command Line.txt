Working Directory -->  Staging Area -->  Local Repository
Sometimes we don't want all our iles to be comitted so we add them to the staging area.


git diff                       => Gives the differences between our current directory and the                          					    local repository.

git checkout                   => Rollback to the previous version in the working directory 
                                  from the local repository.
