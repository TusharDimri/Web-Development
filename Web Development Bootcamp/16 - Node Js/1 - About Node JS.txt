Node JS allows us to create a backend using Javascript(which we already learnt for front end). So, we can do font end + back end with a single programming language. Node js is really fast and allows us to create really scalabe and fast running websites. 

As we already know we can write Javascript code which the browsers execute and give output. Up till now only Javascript was used only top interact with the browser. But, we didn't write any JS Code outside the browser. The code isn't able to reach into the user's computer and get access to the user's data(file system, networking processors, etc). There is a very good reason for that.
You don't want to load a website that's written by some random person with a whole load of Jacascript that's got malicious code like bugs, viruses, malware or hackers trying to get into your local file system.

There are some applications where for example if you were to build a desktop application, like VS Code, you do need to access the file system to load the files and do stuff with them. In these situations, you need to write code that interacts directly with your computer, independent of the browser and that's exactly what Node Js allows us to do. 

Node Js allows us to take Javascriptout of the browser and it liberates it allowing it to interact directly with the hardware of a computer. We can use JS inside out website to give it functionality and behaviour (animations, events, etc.) inside the browser but Node JS allows us to use JS outise the browser. So we can use it to create for example a desktop application and Atom is based on Node JS. We can also use Node Js to run Javascript code on servers.

So we can now use Javascript for both the client side and the server side.
