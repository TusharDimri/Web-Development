JSON : Java Script Object Notation.

Normal JS Object:
var wardrobe = {
    doors: 2,
    drawers: 2,
    colour: "red"
}
JSON:
"{
    "doors":2,
    "drawers":2,
    "colour":"red",
}"
When we create an actual Object in Javascript, we always use var or let to create a variable and the keys are not in quotation marks but JSON Object has its keys as strings.
The reason we use JSON to pass data around the internet is because it's in a format that is human readable but it can also be easily collapsed down to take as little space as possible. So, it;s almost like if you Javascript Object is a full sized wardrobe, while tranporting it, you probably don't want to move it as an entire wardrobe. Just like flat pack furniture at IKEA, you can collapse all your data down to a single string and as long as we maintain the format of a JS Object then once we receive the JSON as string we can build it back upto the original Onject(parst the JSON). 
JSON is not the only format that we can use to receive data from APIs. Some APIs provide other formats like XMLor HTML to get data from them but JSON is the most favoures format as it is much lighter weight then the other two and alsp because it's very easy to turn into a Javascript Object.
