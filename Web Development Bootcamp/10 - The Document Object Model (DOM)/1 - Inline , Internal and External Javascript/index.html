    <!-- Bear in mind that the placement of Javascript and CSS is very important. Yhe code is read from top to bottom and the CSS is placed at the top while the Javascript is placed at the bottom(Just before the closing body tag) preferably. This is because the CSS hsould be loaded with the page and the Javascript shoould be placed after the elements have been set.-->
